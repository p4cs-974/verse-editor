Verse is an open source markdown editor that allows you to export your document to PDF, HTML, or just the raw Markdown file.

The web app is built with a local-first approach, but your documents are also synced to the cloud so you can access them from anywhere.

There should be a simpler way to convert markdown into documents, and Verse is an attempt to do just that.
