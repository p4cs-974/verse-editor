// This component represents a button in the toolbar, which can trigger different actions and/or display popover menus (`./popover.tsx`).
// Buttons must have an icon (preferably from lucide-react) and a text label. the positioning of the elementis is: icon on top, label on the bottom.
// toolbar buttons should have mint colors, and adapt to light/dark mode.
